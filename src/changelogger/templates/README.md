# Changelog Templates

The templates in this directory are rendered via Underscore.js' `_.template`
see: <https://underscorejs.org/#template>.

Newlines in these files generally are intentional, as they translate directly into the compiled
markdown. This allows us to compose the out into CHANGELOG.md easily with our desired formatting.
