# Silvermine-release

If you have this project installed globally you can use the following commands:


## Run a Release

With a clean working directory, run:

`silvermine-release --release`

Begins the release process for a full release:

   * Generates a changelog of bugfixes and features.
   * Calculates the next semver version number and bumps the version in `package.json`.
   * Commits the changes.

## Run a Prerelease

With a clean working directory, run:

`silvermine-release --pre-release=rc`

...or an alpha:

`silvermine-release --pre-release=alpha`

Begins the release process for a pre-release version:

   * Calculates the next semver version number and bumps the version in `package.json`.
   * Commits the changes.

## Tag the Release

With a clean working directory, run:

`silvermine-release --tag`

Creates git tags for publishing a release:

   * Creates the local tag based on the current version found in
   package.json.
   * Pushes the tag to your repository.

## NPM Scripts

To avoid having to install the global package, you can also add npm scripts
to your `package.json`'s `scripts: {}` object.

For example:

```json
   "release-rc": "silvermine-release --pre-release=rc",
   "release": "silvermine-release"
```


## Use Config Only

If you want to skip using the tool, and instead use `release-it` as intended,
you can do that too.

Add a file called `.release-it.js` to your project root, with the following contents:

```javascript
'use strict';

const config = require('@silvermine/standardization/release-it-config');

module.exports = {
   plugins: config.plugins,
   git: config.git,
   gitHub: config.gitHub,
   npm: config.npm,
};
```

You can [configure the above](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it#configuration)
as neccessary to suit your project.

You can now run `release-it` commands, passing our config:

`release-it --config='release-it.js'`


## Release Process

1. With a clean working directory, checkout a branch for your release,
something like `user/prepare-vYOUR.VERSION.NUMBER`.

2. Run `silvermine-release --release` (or `--pre-release={rc | alpha | beta}`).
   * During this step, silvermine-release will generate a changelog, and pause for editing.
   * Press `Y` when you've finished editing the changelog to your liking.
   * Press `Y` when prompted to commit the version bump.
   * Push the branch and create a PR or MR for the release.

3. Once merged, run `silvermine-release --tag`.
   * Press `Y` to tag the release.
   * Press `Y` to push the tags.

4. Publish
   * At this point you can run the registry release manually if applicable.


## Development

For development in this project, the following npm scripts are available:

   * `release:rc`: Perform a pre-release.
   * `release:tag`: Tag the release.
   * `release`: Perform a full release.
   * `release:local`: Utility script called by the scripts above passing the `--dev` option.


## Fixing Problems

   * **Changelog editing**: If something goes wrong during the changelog step, you'll have
   to reset your working directory so you can start over: `git reset HEAD --hard`.
   * **Commit/Bump**: If you need to bail out of the process during this step, you can simply
   issue `CTRL + C` and release-it will gracefully roll back any changes for you.
   * **Tagging**: If something goes wrong during this step (such as if you had changes locally
   but not on the remote), you will either have to:
      * Delete the local/remote tag: `git tag -d TAGNAME`, `git push -d origin TAGNAME`
      * Or, if you have the tag locally, but not remotely, push the tag manually:
        `git push origin TAGNAME`.
